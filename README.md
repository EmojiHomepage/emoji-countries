# 🌐 emoji-countries
The list of the typical emojis of all countries

This emojis list will be used by the [Emoji Homepage](http://emojihomepage.com) 👀.
However, as it is an open source initiative, all other emoji keyboards, websites and tools,
can and are welcome to adopt it 🛠. That way, we can easily find and use the relevant emojis for each country 🎉.

# Contributions

Changes and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request against `master`.
When adding new emojis to the list you should add them both to this `README.md` and to `emoji-countries.json` file.

Ideas of what should be included:
* Food
* Animals
* Flowers
* Activities
* Anything else that you know that people associate the country with 👻

Please, when opening a pull request, consider adding the reason why each emojis is associated with the specific country.
